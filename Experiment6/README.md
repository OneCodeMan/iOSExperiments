Super simple. Just wanted to get acquainted with gesture recognizers.

## Practiced with:
- UIGestureRecognizers

## Possible Improvements:
- UILongPressGestureRecognizer and UIPinchGestureRecognizer are buggy. Cycles through a bunch of quotes while on the gesture.
Limit it to one per gesture instance.
