# Experiment 5 - Map Stuff
I've always wanted to do this. I'm not that interested in maps right now, I don't really have any big ideas. But this one was
in my head for a while, so here it is. ðŸ˜€

- User can enter latitude and longitude, press a button, and the map will navigate to that location and drop a pin.
- Also handles invalid inputs like a baller.
